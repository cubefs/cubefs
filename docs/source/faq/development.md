# CubeFS History

- In July 2022, CubeFS was successfully promoted to a CNCF incubation project.
- In March 2022, an incubation application was submitted to CNCF. It was discovered that ChubaoFS was difficult to pronounce in English, so it was renamed CubeFS.
- In August 2020, OPPO joined the open-source project and became a core contributor and main promoter.
- In June 2019, JD.com donated ChubaoFS to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and entered the CNCF sandbox project in December 2019.
