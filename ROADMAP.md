# Roadmap

Here we draft several todo big features as the engineering roadmap of CubeFS. 


## Caching


With tiered local + distributed buffer cache, cubefs will be a unified platform of data storage & caching acceleration, applied to data-intensive systems (e.g. ML training, recommendations AI model dispatching, et al.) in private/public/hybrid cloud platforms. 


## Atomicity of rename

distributed txn design & efficient implementation


## Multi-version snapshots

for atomic versioned data lake 



## CubeFS for Android


Not only for datacenters, also for mobile devices. CubeFS will work as the storage infrastructure for cloud-enabled mobile applications run on any Android devices.  


## High-level APIs for Mobile Applications
