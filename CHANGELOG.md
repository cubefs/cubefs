## Release v3.0.0 - 2022/04/22

### **UPGRAGDE NOTICE**
If your CubeFS version is v2.3.x or before, please refer to the UPGRADE NOTICE in v2.4.0 for upgrading steps. And also please make sure that your fuse client or objectnode version is equal to or older than the servers, i.e. master, metanode and datanode. In another word, newer versioned client can not be used in a cluster with older versioned servers.

### Notice
This is a significant release based on master branch with a lot of code mainly to support multi layer data layer including blobstore (Erasure-Code) storage, blobstore supports erasure coding storage method(https://github.com/cubeFS/cubefs-blobstore) to support low frequency volume and reduce cost .

Before this we released v3.0.0-beta based on release v2.4.0 (https://github.com/cubeFS/cubefs/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta) , which make volume can be create as standard(3 replica) or low frequency access type(Erasure-Code), but not support multi data layer. 

Release formal version release-v3.0.0 which based on the newest master commit, below is a list of the main features.
1) BlobStore subsystem which supports erasure coding storage.   #212
2) multicache layer, 1st level:client local read cache; 2nd level:hot pool replica; 3nd level:code pool based on erasure code.  #1291 
3) single data replica supported. releated project: https://github.com/oppo-bigdata/shuttle  used for remote shuffle. #1227 
4) client hot online restart(experimental).
5) optimization reduce extents fragmentation.  #1318 
6) manage third part library with go mod.

### **New feature brief introduction**

### **Fault domain(Failure domain)**

**1. Purpose**
  In the cross zone scenario, the reliability need to be improved. Compared with the 2.5 version before, the number of copysets in probability can be reduced. The key point is to use fault domains to group nodesets between multiple zones.

* Reliable papers
https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc13/technical-sessions/presentation/cidon

* Chinese can refer to
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28417779

**2. configuration** 

**1) Master**

* Config file：master.json
   Enable faultDomain set item "faultDomain": true
* Zone count to build domain
  faultDomainGrpBatchCnt，default count:3，can also set 2 or 1
    
  If zone is unavaliable caused by network partition interruption，create nodeset group according to usable zone
Set "faultDomainBuildAsPossible"  true, default is false

  The distribution of nodesets under the number of different faultDomainGrpBatchCnt
  3 zone（1 nodeset per zone）
  2 zone（2 nodesets zone，1 nodeset zone，Take the size of the space as the weight, and build 2 nodeset with the larger space remaining）
  1 zone（3 nodeset in 1 zone）

* Ratio
  **1) The use space threshold of the non-fault domain（origin zone）**
  After the upgrade, the zone used by the previous volume can be expanded, or operated and maintained in the previous way, or the space of 
  the fault domain can be used, but the original space usage ratio needs to reach a threshold, that is, the current configuration item
  The proportion of the overall space used by meta or data
  Default：0.90
  UpdateInterface：
      AdminUpdateZoneExcludeRatio   = "/admin/updateZoneExcludeRatio"
 
  **2) the use space threshold of the nodeset group in the domain**
  Nodeset group will not be used in dp or mp allocation
  default：0.75
  Update interface：
  AdminUpdateDataUseRatio   = "/admin/updateDomainDataRatio"

**2) Datanode && metanode**

  After the fault domain is enabled, a minimum configuration of the fault domain is constructed under the default configuration:
  Each zone contains 1 datanode and 1 metanode, and the zone name needs to be specified in the configuration file
  There are 3 datanodes and 3 metanodes in 3 zones

  For example, three datanodes (metanode) are configured separately:
  "zoneName": "z1",
  "zoneName": "z2",
  "zoneName": "z3",
  Start after configuration, the master will build a nodeset for z1, z2, and z3, and component a nodesetgrp

**3.  Note**
**1) After the fault domain is enabled, all devices in the new zone will join the fault domain**
**2) The created volume will preferentially select the resources of the original zone**
**3) Need add configuration items to use domain resources when creating a new volume according to the table below. By default, the original  zone resources are used first if it's avaliable**

| Cluster:faultDomain | Vol:crossZone | Vol:defaultPriority | Rules for volume to use domain |
h| ------ | ------ | ------ |------ |
| N | N/A | N/A | Do not support domain |
| Y | N | N/A | Write origin resources first before fault domain until origin reach threshold |
| Y | Y |  N | Write fault domain only |
| Y | Y |  Y | Write origin resources first before fault domain until origin reach threshold |

Note: the fault domain is designed for cross zone by default. The fault domain of a single zone is considered as a special case of cross zone, and the options are consistent

example :` curl "http://10.177.200.119:17010/admin/createVol?name=vol_cross5&capacity=1000&owner=cfs&crossZone=true&defaultPriority=true"|jq .`

### **Content Summary**

**1. Purpose**
In order to query the content summary information of a directory efficiently, e.g. total file size, total files and total directories, v2.5 stores such information as the parent directory's xattr. 

The parent directory stores the files, directories and total file size of the current directory. Then only need to make recursive of the sub directories, and accumulate the information stored by the directories to query the content summary information of a directory.

**2. Configuration**
  Client config file: fuse.json
  **1) Enable XAttr**
    "enableXattr":"true"
  Both of xattr and summay have to be set if you want to mount a volume to the local disk. 
  Set summary is enough if you want to access the volume via libsdk.so.

**3. How to use**
  There are two different ways to get the content summary of a directory.
  **1) Fuse mount**
    getfattr -n DirStat yourDirPath
   getfattr can be installed by: yum install attr or apt install attr
  **2) libsdk.so**
    cfs_getsummary (libsdk/libsdk.go)

  **4. Note**
  1)The incremental files' summary information will be held by their parent directories. But the old files will not. Use cfs_refreshsummary 
    (libsdk/libsdk.go) interface to rebuild the content summary information.
  2)The files, directories and total file size are updated asynchronously in the background. Users are not aware of these operations, but it does 
    increase the requests to meta servers (usually doubled). You are recommended to evaluate the impact to your cluster before using this 
    feature.

## Release v2.4.1 - 2021/12/31

### _**UPGRAGDE NOTICE**_

If your CubeFS version is v2.3.x or before, please refer to the UPGRADE NOTICE in v2.4.0 for upgrading steps. And also please make sure that your fuse client or objectnode version is equal to or older than the servers, i.e. master, metanode and datanode. In another word, newer versioned client can not be used in a cluster with older versioned servers.

### Bugfix

* `sdk` makes AppendExtentKeyWithCheck request idempotent [#1224](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/1224)
* `meta` start tcp listen before starting raft [1256](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/1256)
* `raft` remove redundant memcopy when reading raft snapshot to avoid snapshot hanging [1264](https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/pull/1264)

## Release v2.4.0 - 2021/05/14

### _**UPGRAGDE NOTICE**_

If your CubeFS version is v2.3.x or before, and need to upgrade to v2.4.x , please follow the following upgrade steps:

1. first of all, firewall open two more port (17710 & 17810) in your machine to support tcp multiplexing；

   ```
   17710 is calculated by 17210, the port listened by metanode, add 500
   17810 is calculated by 17310, the port listened by datanode, add 500
   ```

2. then add item '"enableSmuxConnPool"=false' in your datanode's config file, upgrade all datanodes; detail steps as follow:

   ```
   a. using new dataNode bin file replace the old version
   b. add  '"enableSmuxConnPool"=false' in your datanode's config file
   c. restart datanode process
   d. update all the datanodes in the custer
   ```

3. update '"enableSmuxConnPool"=true' in your datanode's config file, restart all datanode again;

   ```
   notes: before set enableSmuxConnPool as true, you must finsh step 2. 
   ```

4. upgrade all metanode bin file and restart meta process;

5. upgrade all master  bin file and restart master process;

6. upgrade all client bin file and restart client process; 

The key point of upgrading from previous versions to v2.4.0 is to make sure ALL datanodes are upgraded to the new version with "enableSmuxConnPool" set to "false" before upgrading other components, such as metanode, master and client. Then datanode can be configured to enable smux conn pool, i.e. "enableSmuxConnPool" set to "true".
